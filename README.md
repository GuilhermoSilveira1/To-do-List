# To-do-List
##A must for every one starting. 

Decided to learn more about DOM manipulation, and some dinamics changes to the page, based on user interaction.
It works as a simple to do list, where you can add a task, and cross it out once completed.

Some future ideas to further better this project is to make the list persist when the tab is refreshed, and when it is closed.

##Technologies
Used HTML, CSS and JS.
